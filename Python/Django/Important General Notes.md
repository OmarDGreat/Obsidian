## Important General Notes

### File Locations
- Work in the `mysite` directory with `manage.py` for most commands.
- App-specific code (models, views) lives in `polls/`.

### Dependencies
- Python and Django must be in your PATH.

### Errors
- “Command not found”? Check `python` vs. `python3` or PATH setup.
- Migration issues? Ensure files are saved and you’re in the right directory.

### Terminology
- **Project**: The whole thing (`mysite`).
- **App**: A module within it (`polls`).
- **ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping (Sequelize-like, but built-in with Django).
